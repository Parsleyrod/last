<h7><b>Professional experience</b></h7>
One of my most immersive experiences in media work and web development was creating a website for a local art festival.<br>
It started as a simple project but quickly became more complex with the need to integrate video showcases, photo galleries, and live event updates.
I spent hours optimizing media for fast load times and ensuring compatibility across devices, using tools like Photoshop and JavaScript.<br>
The biggest challenge was balancing design with functionality. In the end, the site was a success, providing a smooth, engaging experience for festival attendees.
So am good in the media work ,anything to do with graphic designing ,camera work,projection in events ,creating some web sites and I ensure sound is working properly in events.<br>
I ensure my work is done to perfection and is exceptional to all.<br><br>
